# Weather App

A weather forecast app, created using React.

The app uses the Open Weather API to retrieve and display 5-day weather forecast data for towns and cities in the UK. It includes detailed information such as: min & max temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed as well as a general description and icon depicting the general forecast.

The app was built using the latest React methodologies, using functional components and incorporating hooks, etc.

During the development process, the app was fully tested using Jest and React Testing Library to write unit tests, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
